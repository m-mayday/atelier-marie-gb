# Atelier Marie GB Translation
A full translation of Atelier Marie GB for the Game Boy Color. Enjoy!


## Changelog

* **V1.1:** Fixed some typos and incorrect line breaks. **Reuploaded on September 5th with a quick fix (there was half an 'n' somewhere but I'm not saying where ðŸ˜œ)**
* **V1.1 - Double Speed:** Added in reference to https://github.com/m-mayday/atelier-marie-gb/issues/3. This enables Double Speed mode, which makes transitions and text rendering faster. A few things to keep in mind about this version:
  * I have not tested it thoroughly. I only tested the first few minutes of the game. The only thing I noticed is a slight difference in audio when navigating menus (like changing item 'tabs'), not a big deal IMO.
  * While it should be fine for the most part, I won't fix any artifacts you may encounter, since the game wasn't designed with this mode in mind.
  * **If playing on real hardware, be mindful that this increases power consumption.**

# Important!
**I've seen some issues when using mGBA (even the retroarch core), like certain text boxes/lines not showing up when checking out items or recipes. This happens with the original game as well, so please use a different emulator!**

## Notes
I tried to keep character/item/location names consistent with the ones used recently in Atelier Marie Remake. In cases where that wasn't possible, I leaned on the translation of Atelier Marie + Elie by the Atelier Traduction team http://ateliertraduction.forumactif.org

However, there were also some limitations with the length of some of these names, mainly items. So be prepared for names not being 1:1 and shortened/abbreviated.


## Disclaimer
I started this project with the sole intention of seeing if I could modify a game. Once I realized I could, I didn't want to stop there but my Japanese is not advanced enough to translate a game like this.
Thus, for the sake of transparency, I should tell you that I relied heavily on machine translation. I understand being reluctant over this but I didn't simply use the translation as it was; I do have some knowledge of Japanese and I used dictionaries extensively, as well as trying to adjust sentences to the in-game context.
That being said, I think it turned out well and the game is playable from start to finish without too much awkwardness, but I let you be the judge of that :)
