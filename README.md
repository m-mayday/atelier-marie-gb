# Atelier Marie GB Translation
A full translation of Atelier Marie GB for the Game Boy Color. Enjoy!

## Notes
I tried to keep character/item/location names consistent with the ones used recently in Atelier Marie Remake. In cases where that wasn't possible, I leaned on the translation of Atelier Marie + Elie by the Atelier Traduction team http://ateliertraduction.forumactif.org

However, there were also some limitations with the length of some of these names, mainly items. So be prepared for names not being 1:1 and shortened/abbreviated.


## Disclaimer
I started this project with the sole intention of seeing if I could modify a game. Once I realized I could, I didn't want to stop there but my Japanese is not advanced enough to translate a game like this.
Thus, for the sake of transparency, I should tell you that I relied heavily on machine translation. I understand being reluctant over this but I didn't simply use the translation as it was; I do have some knowledge of Japanese and I used dictionaries extensevely, as well as trying to adjust sentences to the in-game context.
That being said, I think it turned out well and the game is playable from start to finish without too much awkwardness, but I let you be the judge of that :)
